# Spotify-Data-Pipeline-ETL-AWS
This project builds an automated data pipeline for extracting, transforming, and analyzing Spotify data using AWS services. AWS Lambda fetches data from the Spotify API, processes it, and stores it in Amazon S3. AWS Glue and Amazon Athena enable structured querying and efficient analytics.
